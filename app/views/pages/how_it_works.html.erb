          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500">Right now there are 8 pieces available. I made each of these by hand on my ipad. No AI was used. There are 3 sizes available and only 33 of each size. These are the first of their kind and tell a better story than any art you'll have on your walls</p>

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">I am using Pictorem to fulfil orders. 
                                    When an NFT is purchased, the backend of this website 
                                    automatically calls their API and creates an order for high quality canvass prints</P>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">Each piece comes with the contract of the 
                                    NFT in the package. As well as a way to transfer 
                                    the NFT to a new wallet in case your wallet gets hacked, or you lose your keys.</P>
