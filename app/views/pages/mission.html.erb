        <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">I have tried a lot of different approaches to achieve this. From living in El Salvador to selling coffee, I've learned one thing. For mass adoption and the financial freedom of humanity, Bitcoin needs to cross the digital barrier into the physical world. That's why I'm selling art, with Ordinals (Bitcoin NFTs) attached as proof of ownership and the certificate of authenticity.</p>
        <p class="mt-10 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">I don't know where this is going to go. This is largely an expirement. Once Things have been figured out from me selling my art, this website will hopefully turn into an awesome combination of Etsy and Opensea, but not for shitcoins, for Bitcoin.</p>
        <p class="mt-10 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">Setting up a good world for the generations of people that we'll never meet is my driving motivator. Only because that's what I wish our past generations did for us.</p>
